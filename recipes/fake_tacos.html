            So my good friend Luis and his family are from Mexico. 
            So growing up he had traditional Mexican tacos. When he and 
            his family moved to the US he discovered the <i>Americanized</i> 
            version of tacos. He is not a fan of places like Taco Bell so he's 
            taken to calling these American Taco's "Fake Taco".
        </p>
        <p>
            However, I am a good ole regular American so I like our "Fake Tacos". 
            Do I prefer a traditional taco most of the time? Yes. But I also like
            the ease and convenience of American tacos. Which is why I have this 
            recipe.
