        <p>
            Discada is a popular dish in Northen Mexico that contains a mixture 
            of grilled meats, traditionally cooked on a disk. It's somewhat similar 
            to paella but it makes a great alternative for a BBQ. This is a hearty
            and flavorful meal that you're sure to love.
